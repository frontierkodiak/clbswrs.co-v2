### cool-plane-alert

[repo](https://github.com/frontierkodiak/cool-plane-alert)

Simple tool to get notified when cool planes pass overhead. Developed to satisfy my own urges, but maybe someone else will find it useful. Requires an ADS-B Exchange API key. 

Codebase is in rough shape: I mostly used this as an exercise to refresh my Python chops after a years-long detour into MATLAB. Additionally, ADS-B Exchange has been bought by a PE firm since the last time I touched this, and I have not tested the code against their updated API. 

Refactoring & additional features (e.g. watchlists) are tabled as I focus on Polli. I'll polish and package this tool when I have a free (rainy) weekend.

*Details coming soon.*
